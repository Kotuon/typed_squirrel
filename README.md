## Overview
Squirrel Engine is a custom C++ game engine built with OpenGL, created as a sandbox for exploring game engine architecture, rendering techniques, and experimental features. It includes foundational engine systems, a dual quaternionâ€“based transform system for efficient object manipulation, and integrated Dear ImGui tools for real-time debugging and editing.

Future development plans include expanding ImGui functionality for enhanced runtime control and implementing a GPU-driven particle system using compute shaders.

## Technologies

* C++ (Visual Studio Code)
* OpenGL
* Dear ImGui
* GLM, GLFW

## Features

* __Event System:__ Centralized framework for handling engine-wide events.
* __Dual Quaternion Transform:__ Efficiently stores and manipulates object transforms using dual quaternions.
* __Fixed/Variable Updates:__ Supports both update modes for consistent physics and smooth rendering.
* __Dear ImGui Editor/Debugging Tools:__ Real-time inspection and control of object values and engine parameters.
